# <My First Webpage>

## Description

My motivation behind this project was to take as much as I could from the prework course, to help me excel at bootcamp. I built this project to help me learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On this page you will see how I applied my prework knowledge to create a webpage for the first time.
